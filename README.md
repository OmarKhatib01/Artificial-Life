## Overall Architecture

The system here represents an evolutionary algorithm. It is comprised of multiple classes for a simulated world, a solution which creates a robot with body parts, joints, motors and sensors, a simulation class which runs the simulation, and a parallelHillClimber class that "evolves" the robot generated by the solution by assessing it during a run of the simulation against some fitness function with the goal of optimizing some behaviour.

This work employs 2 main libraries, the physics engines [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/), and the Python Robot Simulator [Pyrosim](https://github.com/jbongard/pyrosim), and builds on the turorial to build the framwework described in the Ludobots subreddit starting [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/installation/)

## Running the Code:
### Follow the steps below to reproduce results and learn more about each assignment

1. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice

2. create a virtual environment for the directory 

3. switch to the branch `assgmtX` by running `git checkout assgmtX` in your console

4. run `main.py`
